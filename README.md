The Meal Planner Web App

Description:
The Meal Planner web app was created purely out of frustration and curiousity. Frustration because I can never decide what to cook and curiosity of API's. Then Walaaa! Majic. The Meal Planner Web App was born. You can access this project live at https://food-food.netlify.app. Or if you would like to take it up a notch, feel free to fork the repository and create your own magic. I hope you enjoy!
